#Today i have learnt different location match,redirect,rewrite,proxy-pass and add-headers 

#location match 
### exact location match 
location = /somename {
    return statement;
}
### prefix location match 
location / somename {
    return stataement;
}
### regex location match 
location ~/ somename {
    return sattement;
}

#Redirect simply when the location hits a url or file it will redirect to given redirect location 
location = / anyfile or url {
    return 301 or 302 /redirect filename or url;
}
#where 301 code means permantenly moved 
#where 302 code means temporarly moved 
#when 200 is used it will display the content or statement in the return statement 
#400 series means error message
#Redirect only redirects but the url or file path location will be changed means it will show the location of redirect url or file path 

#Rewrite simply when the location hits a url or file it willrewrite to given rewrite location 
location =/ anyfile or url {
    rewrite /rewrite filename or url; 
}  
 or 
rewrite /anyfile or url /rewrite filename or url;
#Rewrite dosenot changes the file path that means the file path will be same as the requested one but it will rewrite it 

#proxy_pass proxy-pass also similar to rewrite of a file 
location =/ anyfile or url {
    proxy_pass url or filename;
}
#Proxy-pass dosenot changes the file path that means the file path will be same as the requested one but it will rewrite it
